# Car Market Analysis

## Overview
This project explores key characteristics of the automotive market using a structured exploratory data analysis approach.  
The focus is on understanding relationships between pricing, performance, fuel efficiency, and vehicle segments.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a car dataset containing information on:
- manufacturer and model
- engine specifications
- fuel efficiency (city and highway MPG)
- drivetrain, transmission, and vehicle size
- market popularity and MSRP

The dataset is included in the repository for reproducibility.

## Analysis Scope
The project covers:
- data cleaning and type normalization
- feature engineering (e.g. efficiency and price-performance metrics)
- exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics
- group-based comparisons across vehicle segments
- correlation analysis between key numerical variables

## Key Questions
- How does vehicle price relate to engine performance?
- How do fuel efficiency patterns differ across vehicle segments?
- Are there systematic price differences by drivetrain or vehicle size?
- How do city and highway MPG vary by transmission type?

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Status
Work in progress.
